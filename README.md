# python-mcscoreboard

A Python script for processing Minecraft's `scoreboard.dat` files into more useful formats for Python usage.

## Usage

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get install any dependencies â€” as of right now, there's only one, that being [NBT](https://pypi.org/project/NBT/).
`mcscoreboard.py` is only written to be imported currently, but will eventually be usable on its own at the command-line.
