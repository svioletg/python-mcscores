# python-mcscoreboard

A Python script for processing Minecraft's `scoreboard.dat` files into more useful formats for Python usage.

## Usage

You can install `mc_score_utils` as a package by using the git link: `pip install git+https://github.com/svioletg/python-mcscores.git`

It can then be used either as a command-line tool, via `py -m mc_score_utils`, or imported into a project with
`from mc_score_utils.mc_score_utils import Scoreboard`.

Alternatively, the package only contains a single script, so you could instead directly download `mc_score_utils.py` from 
`src/mc_score_utils`, install its requirements (see `requirements.txt`), and use it that way.
